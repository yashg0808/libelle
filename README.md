# Libelle

Libelle is an open-source, volunteer-powered platform that helps people apply their skills where they matter most.  
Built by The Chamber of Us (TCUS), it supports ethical collaboration and real-world impact in ways traditional systems often fail to enable.

---

## What Libelle Does

Libelle is designed to:

- Collect and organize volunteer and contributor information in a secure, structured way
- Match people’s skills, interests, and availability to real-world, mission-driven projects
- Support transparent, ethical, and human-centered collaboration
- Run on lightweight, sovereign infrastructure, including low-cost hardware like Raspberry Pi

This repository is the **public monorepo** for Libelle. It contains the application code, architecture, and documentation needed to run, extend, and contribute to the platform.

Sensitive credentials and production secrets are not stored here.

## Tech Stack

**Backend**
- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn
- Google Drive + Sheets APIs
- Modular resume / document parsing

**Frontend**
- React
- Tailwind
- Form + file upload handling

**Infrastructure**
- Raspberry Pi (Pathfinder Node)
- Cloudflare Tunnel (public ingress)
- Tailscale (secure admin access)
- NGINX (reverse proxy)
- systemd (service management)

---

## ⚠️ Security Model

This is a public repository by design. Therefore:

- No credentials are committed here
- No API keys or tokens are stored here
- All examples in `/infrastructure` are templates only
- Production configuration lives in a **private infrastructure repo**

- If you are deploying to a server or Pi, you must create:
 ```bash
/etc/libelle/libelle.env
  ```
- And pass sensitive values there, including:
```bash
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON=...
GOOGLE_SHEET_ID=...
DRIVE_ROOT_FOLDER_ID=...
```
---

## Getting Started (Local Dev)

**Backend**
```bash
cd backend
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload
```
- Runs at: http://127.0.0.1:8000

**Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
- Runs at: http://localhost:3000

- Frontend should point to:
```js
const API_URL = "http://localhost:8000"
```
- Later in production, this becomes:
 ```js
const API_URL = "https://api.libelle.io"
```
## Production Deployment (Summary)

On the Pathfinder Node (Raspberry Pi):
- Backend runs as a systemd service
- Frontend is served via NGINX
- Cloudflare Tunnel exposes HTTPS
- Tailscale provides secure SSH

Example service file lives in:
 ```text
/libelle/infrastructure/systemd/libelle-backend.service.template
 ```
Do not copy secrets into the repo.
